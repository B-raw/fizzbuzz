# fizzbuzz

We took this a bit further than we meant to and did the following:

- edited the Integer Class so that fizzbuzz was now a function of Integers eg 3.fizzbuzz => "fizz"
- created an array method that returned an array of fizzbuzz values up to the value given 
- called above array with the argument 10000000... the computer still managed it in seconds.
